This is a personel project that I am developing.
It's has a combat system like souls like and probably gonna be a metroidvania. Planning to add an upgrade system to get new active skills instead of making stat upgrades.
I plan to use a visual novel style to tell the story.
Unfortunatly since I don't have animations for everything, player uses same animations for different attacks.
